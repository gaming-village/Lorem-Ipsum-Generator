# Contributing

This text file is for contributing code to the project.

## General Information

### Editing code

To edit the code, you will need to fork the project. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies and then `yarn start` to start the server. A web browser should open with a local copy of the project, which you can begin editing.

## Test your changes

Before submitting code, make sure to run the game to make sure everything works as intended, and that your changes have not negatively affected any other  sectors of the game.

## Code Conventions

- Use spaces around parentheses: `if (1 === 2) {`
- Use camel case in Javascript (e.g. `myVariable`), and hyphens for classes, ID's and other HTML-ish stuff (e.g. `this-is-a-header`).
- Comment where appropriate, but not too extensively. If you have what could potentially be a confusing piece of code for other programmers, either add comments or simplify the code.
- Try to keep variable and function names descriptive.
